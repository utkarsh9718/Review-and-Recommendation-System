  I am hearing impaired and reply on closed caption/subtitles. I just ordered Season 7 of The Good Witch and subtitles are not offered. I wish to return this purchase and have my account credited.

  Been a fan of the Good Witch since the first movie. Love the characters, the story lines and the cast.  So happy to finally have Season7, and look forward to many seasons to come.
